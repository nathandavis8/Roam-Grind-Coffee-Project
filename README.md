# Roam-&-Grind-Coffee-Co-Project

## Project Background
Roam & Grind Coffee Co. is an e-commerce company founded in 2019 that specializes in selling specialty coffee beans in the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. I’m partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales and marketing teams and create an interactive dashboard that stakeholders can use to compare sales by year, region, and top 5 customers by roast type, product size, and loyalty card status. **This report uses 1k synthetic order records from Jan 2019 to August 2022, with three tables: orders, customers, and products.**

## Executive Summary
Roam & Grind Coffee Co.’s analysis of sales records from Jan 2019 to Aug 2022 shows annual sales decreasing in 2022 with an 11% downward trend in sales. The US market contributes to 79% of sales, while the UK accounts for only 6%. Sales of all coffee types fluctuate drastically on a month-to-month basis, with no clear seasonality to the fluctuations. There are five anomalies in sales; all spikes in sales were due to bulk purchasing of the 2.5kg bags of coffee. Roam & Grind can benefit from customer re-engagement campaigns, enhancing loyalty card benefits, and introducing a subscription plan to increase customer lifetime value. Targeted growth in Ireland and the UK, with targeted marketing, will strengthen Roam & Grind’s market position and drive sustainable growth. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
  - Sales Trends Analysis: An evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on purchasing trends.
  - Product Level Performance: An analysis of Roam & Grind's product lines, understanding their impact on sales.
  - Loyal Card Program: An assessment of the loyalty card program on customer retention and sales.
  - Regional Comparisons: An evaluation of sales and orders by region.

## Recommendations

**Customer Growth and Retention**
**Boost Repeat Purchases:** Target single-purchase customers with personalized re-engagement campaigns and introduce subscriptions to the loyalty program that offers a discounted rate to incentivize frequent purchases and increased retention.

**Revitalize Customer Acquisition:** Refine Roam & Grind’s messaging to target a specific niche, attracting new customers and re-engaging past customers who share this message. Obtain customer feedback on how Roam & Grind can improve its services. Ask questions regarding shipping, quality, price, and interests to better understand customers and areas of improvement.  

**Regional Growth Strategies**
Target Growth in Ireland and UK: Tailor promotions to be culturally relevant to capture growth potential to increase sales in these markets 
Continued Focus on US: As the high-performing market, the majority of resources should be allocated to the US market, with marketing tailored to local preferences. Pushing the improved loyalty card program.

## Questions and Concerns

- What benefits does the loyalty card currently provide?
- What information is required to sign up for the loyalty card? Many loyalty cardholders do not have emails, potentially warranting further investigation.
- Regarding the anomalies causing spikes in sales, were they caused by promotions during those months? 
- With customers mostly buying one time, why are there such drastic swings in monthly sales?
